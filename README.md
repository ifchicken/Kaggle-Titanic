# Kaggle-Titanic Project

The sinking of Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew were killed in this tragedy. The main reason leading to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for all the people. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this project, I try to analyze what sorts of people were likely to survive and apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
